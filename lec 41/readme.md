# Today checklist

1. Merge sort algorithm
2. Example explanation
3. Merge sort code
4. Merge sort time and space complexity
5. is merge sort stble
6. Application of merge sort
7. Drawback of merge sort

--> it is used divide and corner approach
--> also used the recursion




## Merge sort algorithm

-> Divide the array into 2 equal havels
-> root the 2 subarray repeatively using recursion 
-> merge the two sorted subarray To create an overall sorted array (self work)


## Time and space complexity

--> Substitution method




## is merge sort stable ==> yes

--> application of merge sort ==> it is used where the large data set is available
