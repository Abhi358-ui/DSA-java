## Insertion sort

Take one element iterate through the sorted and find the correct position of its element

Example :

Given array = [7, 3, 4, 8, 9]

step 1: 3 7 | 4 8 9
step 2: 3 4 7 | 8 9
step 3: 3 4 7 8 | 9
step 4: 3 4 7 8 9
                   in the above example we iterate over the array and take one element and placed at the corrected position
