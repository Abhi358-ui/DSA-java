1. bubble sort algorithm
2. Bubble sort time and Space complexity
3. Maximum number of swap in the wrost case in bubble sort
4. How to optimize the bubble sort in the case of nearly sorted arrays
5. Stable and usable sort 
6. is bubble sort an in place algorithmti

--> bubble sort algorithm application like contact book, sorting item in e commerace website


## Bubble sort algorithm process

--> we do a certain no of passes and in every passes we compare adjacent element and swap them if they are not in correct order

--> in every iteration the largest number in part of array to be processed gets its correct position


## Stable and unastable sort

--> any sorting algorithm is stable and unstable 

--> in the stable sort the duplicate element of the array is same in the after sorting of the array

Example :

arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 3*]

stable sort ==> [2, 3, 3*, 4, 5]
unstable sort ==> [2, 3*, 3, 4, 5]

*** and bubble sort is stable sorted algorithm ***

*** Bubble sort also is a in place algorithm ***









## recusion basic tips

1. see the base case carefully
2. recurrnce relationship are cover all the items
3. order of self work and recursive work
