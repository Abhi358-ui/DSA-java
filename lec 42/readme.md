# Today Checklist

1. quick sort
2. time and space complexity of quick sort
3. is quick sort is a stable?
4. is quick sort is inplace?



## Process 

1. Choose pivot and we put it at its right position
2. we rearrenge element before and after pivot index such that smaller element is left of side of pivot element and large element is right of side of pivot element



##  Quick sort a not a stable algorithm


## Time and space complexity 

Wrost case = O(n*n)
best case and average case = O(log n)
