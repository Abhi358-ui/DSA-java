## Recursion ##
===================

## Today checklist

1. Introducing of recurive function
2. Working rule of recurisive function
3. Problem based on recursion



## Recursion

==> A function calling itself with different parameter and a base case to terminate the infinite loop

==> In recursion we solve a bigger problem by solving smaller sub problem

==> In recursion we solve problem in term of function

==> A function call itself to solve its subproblem




## The Recursion spell

1. Identifying the smaller subproblem -> Let recursion solve it

2. Self work  -> do your work

3. Identify the base case -> Smallest problem for which the answer is obvious


# Note : Define the which work do first self work or recursive work

# Note : Defining the base case and terminate the code because it go to infinite state




## Working a recursive function

methodName(N Parameter)
{
    <!--! Base case -->
    if(halfCondition)
    {
        return result
    }

    <!--! Recursive work -->
    return methodName(N Parameter)

    <!--! Self work -->
}





## Why do we need recursion

1. Recursion is used to solve complex problem

2. Recursion is used to simplyfy the problem and solve and creating the simple logic
